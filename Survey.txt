Survey/Report
Information about the Enrollment Questionnaire
Thank you for joining My Retina Tracker™ the Foundation Fighting Blindness' Registry. To make My Retina Tracker™ as useful as possible for you, your doctor and the FFB research community, we need you to answer a number of questions about your visual history and current condition, family history of retinal disease, diagnosis, treatment and participation in research. You will be reminded to update this information on an annual basis.

Since the enrollment questionnaire is fairly long, it is broken up into 18 topics with a range of between 2 and 11 questions in each section. Most sections have between 3 and 5 questions. You can stop at any time and come back to complete the survey later.

If some pages or questions do not apply to you, you should skip them. The exceptions to this are 7 required questions. Their locations in the survey are indicated in the Table of Contents below.
