The common allele at this SNP is known as Arg102; the variant and risk allele is known as Gly102. The risk allele, in orientation to the dbSNP entry for this rs#, is (G). In one of the largest case-control studies, the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.61, and for homozygotes, 3.26 (p = 4.5 x 10e-12).'

A study of 3 case-control groups of Americans of European descent, comprising about 900 ARMD patients in total, indicated that having one rs3775291(A) allele reduces the odds of having dry ARMD about 30%, and being a rs3775291(A;A) homozygote cuts your odds by more than half.'

Further confirmed [PMID 18207215, PMID 18206206]. The genotype at highest risk is (A;A). Note, most studies have shown that that this SNP is highly predictive (i.e. is in near perfect (D\'>0.98) linkage disequilibrium) with rs10490924, thus the status of one very closely predicts the status of the other.A 2011 meta-analysis concluded that rs11200638(A;G) and (A;A) carriers had 2.243 and 8.669 times the risk of developing AMD, respectively, when compared with those who carry the (G;G) genotype.'
